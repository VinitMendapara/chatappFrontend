Hi Abhishek, 

As discussed, please find below the details of the assignment. We expect you to submit it by Wednesday EoD (27 Jan 2021) at the latest.

The objective of this task is to test your coding skills to further proceed with the application process.

You have to build a text/image chat web application using MERN Stack and upload the application on Heroku. The chat application must have a registration/login page where users after login, can see all the registered users and send them direct msgs. Every chat window must have these 2 features:
1. "Typing" on the status bar should be realtime if the sender is typing
2. Single tick if not received, double tick if received

Do get back if you have any questions or concerns.
